I am a young researcher interested in anything at the intersection of environmental economics, finance and urban economics.
<br>
I am currently working for the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/">Transition Pathway Initiative</a> analysing company's preparedness to transition to a low carbon economy. Investors use our research as a tool for climate action.
