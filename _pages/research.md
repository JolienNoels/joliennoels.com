## Master Dissertations

**Temperature, Air Pollution and Urban Development (2018)**  
  *I  study  the  effects  of  air  pollution  on  local  temperature  in  Chinese  cities using NASA satellite data. An indirect effect of air pollution through the urban heat island effect (UHI) is studied through a novel estimation technique of the UHI. I also show that air pollution’s effect has been impacted by Chinese anti-pollution policies.  Finally,  I show that air pollution has a stronger effect on urban areas than rural areas (holding all else equal).*

**The current state of robo-advice: the financial model behind the hype (2017)**  
  *Robo-advice, which is essentially automated financial advice, is a new field that is rapidly growing. Only a limited amount of research has been conducted with regard to how robo-advisors work. Moreover, there is not yet a consensus about the definition of the term ‘robo-advisor’. This master thesis aims to start filling in that gap. Cross-sectional data was collected from 30 different robo-advisors in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands. The results show some significant differences between the literature, the SEC's guidance framework and the real world robo-advisors. More particularly, robo-advisors claim to follow academic and especially Nobel-price winning research for their underlying algorithms. However, our research shows that they have become more sales tools for ETFs than real personalized, algorithm assisted, sophisticated portfolio management tools. It is unclear whether the model that is at the heart of the large majority of robo-advisors, MPT, is correctly used and extended to complement for the known potential flaws. Also, the use of ETFs raises questions about potential risks in the future. Finally, although robo-advisors lean on the merits of passive investment management, their total cost structure in the sample is more comparable to active asset management."*
